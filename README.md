# ansi-escapes

ANSI escape codes for manipulating the terminal.

WARNING: This repo is in development. It was automatically generated with [mkpylib](https://github.com/shawwn/scrap/blob/master/mkpylib). If you're reading this message, it means that I use this repo for my own purposes right now. It might not do anything at all; the default functionality is `print('TODO')`.

If you really want to try it out, feel free. I recommend reading through the code and commit history to see if it does what you need, or [ask me](#contact) for status updates.

Stay tuned!

## Install

```
python3 -m pip install -U ansi-escapes
```

(That strange-looking setup command is because I've found it to be the most reliable. The `pip` command often aliases to python 2, and `pip3` often installs to the wrong Python package directory.)

## Usage

```py
import ansi_escapes

print('TODO')
```
